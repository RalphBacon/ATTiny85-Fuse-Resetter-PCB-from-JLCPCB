# ATTiny85 Fuse Resetter PCB (from JLCPCB)
I finally created an Arduino Shield PCB for the ATTiny85 fuse resetter covered in video #87.

The PCB is an Arduino Shield (version R3) and it fits on top of an Arduino in the usual fashion. It allows us to use all 6 pins on the ATTiny85 as GPIO pins. Details in the video!

The code and method of resetting the ATTiny85 fuses is the same, with the exact same sketch but it's just more natural to use a shield that lays flat.

Right at the end of the video I mention that I have a few (very few) spare boards up for grabs so first come first served. Look at the pinned comments to see when the last one has already been claimed.

Components that I ordered were from LCSC Electronics - Shop Online: https://lcsc.com, easy to order and you then have stocks of components for future projects afterwards.  

Smaller buzzers are available from Banggood but I can't tell whether the holes will fit the PCB:

A complete list of components required for this project is on my GitHub for you to download.

I have a small number of battery holders, ZIF sockets, Buzzers, and on/off switches all of which were chosen for this PCB. Watch the video to find out how to contact me if you want these.

The Gerber files (corrected) will be made available soon too. All the EasyEDA files, in fact, will be made available. Keep watching my GitHub where they will be listed. Then you can modify this design or order your own boards.
